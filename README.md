### Bookcase 📚

An app for posting your book recommendations 👍

### User Stories 👩‍💻

_Note: **-** is partially done_

- [x] A form for users to submit data
- [x] A page showing all the data
- [x] Semantic form elements with correctly associated labels
- [x] A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
- [x] A schema describing your database in your README
- [-] Tests for server routes and database access
- [-] Not process user input as SQL commands
- [x] Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)

### What we learnt 🧠

- How to create an SQL database
- How to query our database from within our app
- How to connect to our database running on a local server
- How to use a model.js file to hold our SQL queries
- How to store our database connection string in an environment variable

### Future improvements 🤞

- A page showing all books added to the app and the user who added them.
- A way to see all books added by a specific user.
- GitHub Actions CI setup running tests when we push
- Finish app deloyment to Heroku
- A way for users to login and see their books.
- A way for users to rate books and recommend them to each other.
